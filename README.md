# QOSF-Cohort-7-Screening-Task
Welcome to my Github repository for the Quantum Open Source Foundation Cohort 7 Screening Task! This is my submission for the coding task designed to evaluate potential candidates for the QOSF mentorship program. I have completed a set of quantum programming exercises using Python and the Qiskit framework, which demonstrate my understanding of quantum computing concepts and proficiency in Python programming.

In this repository, you will find my solution to the QOSF screening task, which includes detailed documentation and comments to explain my thought process and approach to each exercise. My submission is organized according to the instructions and guidelines provided by the QOSF mentorship program, and I have used the submission template provided to ensure that my solution is easy to review and evaluate.

I am excited to be considered for the QOSF mentorship program, and I hope that my submission demonstrates my passion and dedication to quantum computing. Thank you for taking the time to review my work, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn from and contribute to the quantum open source community.
